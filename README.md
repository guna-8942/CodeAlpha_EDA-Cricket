# EDA Objectives
Understand the structure and quality of the data

Identify top performers and trends in scoring

Analyze how batting position affects performance

Evaluate contribution of boundaries to total runs

Visualize key relationships (e.g., runs vs balls)

Detect anomalies and inconsistencies

# ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Most players rely heavily on boundaries (4s and 6s)

Strong correlation observed between balls faced and total runs

Minor data inconsistencies detected where boundary runs exceeded total runs
